# Linux Production Setup Guide

This setup guide will instruct and explain the process in which Exon is set up on a Linux based distribution. The majority of the setup is taken care of by the installers, which will automate the installation and set up of the prerequisites. That said, there is a small portion of this guide that requires manual set up.

If you are doing dev work on Exon or just want to set him up manually, please follow the [Linux Dev Setup Guide](../../../Setup-Guides/Development/Linux-Dev-Setup-Guide/).
